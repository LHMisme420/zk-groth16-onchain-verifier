VATA Soul Check

Public demo for heuristic-based code integrity scoring and zero-knowledge
experimentation. Includes ZK Groth16 proof pipelines and on-chain verification
experiments.

Live Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Lhmisme/vata-soul-check



This repository demonstrates:
- Building a Groth16 circuit
- Generating proving and verification keys
- Producing a witness and proof
- Deploying a Solidity verifier
- Verifying a proof on-chain

Includes full reproducible steps.
